# This is a placeholder file for the sentiment analysis model
# In a real implementation, this would be a pickled machine learning model
# For now, the system will use TextBlob for sentiment analysis
# 
# To create a real model, you would:
# 1. Train a model using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or similar
# 2. Save it using pickle.dump(model, open('sentiment_model.pkl', 'wb'))
# 3. The stream_processor.py will automatically load and use this model
#
# Example model training code:
# from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
# from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
# import pickle
# 
# # Load your training data
# # X_train, y_train = load_training_data()
# 
# # Create and train model
# vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=10000)
# X_train_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
# 
# model = LogisticRegression()
# model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
# 
# # Save model and vectorizer
# with open('sentiment_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
#     pickle.dump(model, f)
# with open('vectorizer.pkl', 'wb') as f:
#     pickle.dump(vectorizer, f)
